    There is a rapid growth in the number of available biological datasets due
    to the decreasing cost of collecting and storing the data, together with
    high-throughput data collection instruments. Modern instruments enables
    analysis of biological data at different levels, from DNA sequences
    through cell structures and up to the function of organs. This leads to the
    potential for novel insights to the underlying biological mechanisms in the
    development and progression of diseases such as cancer. The wide range of
    these different biological datasets has led to the development of a wealth
    of software packages and systems for researchers to use in data exploration
    and analysis.

    Researchers tailor the exploration and analysis of their datasets using a
    range of different tools and systems. Because of the specialized nature of
    each step of the analysis, few of the tools provide useful interfaces for
    analyses across programming languages and frameworks. In addition, reporting
    the details of an analysis becomes a tedious task because of the long list
    of different tools, input parameters and reference to databases. The lack of
    such details can complicate reusing the analyses for other datasets, or even
    reproducing the results of the original data. This increases both analysis
    time and leaves unrealized potential for scientific insights.

    This dissertation argues that, instead, we can design systems for
    exploring and analyzing high-throughput biological datasets from small
    composable pieces. In particular we show the viability through software
    container technologies together with well-defined interfaces, configuration,
    and orchestration. This approach simplifies the development of analysis
    pipelines and interactive data exploration applications. In addition it
    provides the necessary information to reproduce analyses and share the
    methods across teams. 
    
    We show the feasibility of our approach through applications for analyzing
    high-throughput \gls{dna} sequencing datasets, and for exploring gene
    expression data integrated with questionnaire and registry datasets,
    together with online databases. Our evaluation shows how we effectively
    capture provenance in analysis pipelines and exploration applications to
    simplify reproducibility and encourage sharing of methods and tools.
