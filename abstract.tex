    There is a rapid growth in the number of available biological datasets due
    to the decreasing cost of data collection, and the potential for 
    novel insights to the underlying biological mechanisms in the development
    and progression of diseases such as cancer. The wide range of different
    biological datasets has led to the development of a wealth of software
    packages and systems to explore and analyze these datasets. However, there
    are few tools that are designed with the full analysis pipeline in mind,
    from raw data into interpretable results. While current tools can be used to 
    provide novel insights in disease, there is little emphasis on reporting
    and sharing information about tool versions, input parameters, and other
    information that can help others use the same known methods on their own
    datasets. This leads to unnecessary difficulties to reuse known methods,
    and difficulties in reproducing analyses, increasing the analysis time and
    leaves unrealized potential for scientific insights.

    This dissertation argues that, instead, we can design a unified approach
    that integrates disparate systems and data into fully reproducible
    biological data analysis frameworks. In particular, we show how software
    container technologies together with well-defined interfaces,
    configurations, and orchestration provide the necessary foundation to build
    reproducible analysis pipelines for biological datasets, as well as highly
    interactive data exploration applications. 

    We show the feasibility of our approach through a number of different
    applications for analyzing and exploring biological datasets.  We developed
    these applications to meet the requirements of researchers in systems
    epidemiology and precision medicine. We evaluate the approach through these
    systems using real datasets and analyses. Our results show that our approach
    can be used to enable reproducible data analysis and exploration of
    high-throughput biological datasets while still providing the performance of
    related systems.
