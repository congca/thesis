    First I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Lars Ailo Bongo for his
    relentless support and encouragement during my time as a PhD student. He has
    indeed shown me what tough love is, and I am grateful for that. 

    I would like to thank my co-advisors Professor Eiliv Lund and Associate
    Professor Karina Standahl Olsen for their wonderful ideas and warm welcome
    into a research field that was not my own. 

    I would like to extend my gratitude to Professor Michael Hallett and Vanessa
    Dumeaux for their hospitality when I visited their lab in Montreal in
    2016. I do not think this thesis would have been as interesting without the
    projects I was fortunate enough to be a part of. Thank you! 

    I would like to thank my long time office wife Einar, Morten, Nina, and
    the BDPS lab at UiT. 

    Thank you to past or current students at UiT: Jan-Ove, Vegard, Helge,
    Magnus, Erlend, Kristian, Martin, Amund, Michael, and many more. You have
    all contributed to nine wonderful years at the University!
    
    I would like to thank my colleagues at the Department of Computer Science,
    especially the technical staff, led by Maria Wulff Hauglann.
    
    Thank you to everyone in the \gls{nowac} research group, you have all been
    wonderful to collaborate with! 

    Thank you to the PhD students at Nordlandssykehuset in Bod√∏ who have been my
    closest colleagues during the final push of my PhD. 
    
    I would like to thank my mom and dad, and my younger brother for their
    ever-present support. 

    Finally, Ane for her continuous love and support, and her
    \emph{endurance} through all of my big or small projects.
