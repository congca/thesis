% Thesis project two parts: 
% 1: Systems for exploring genomic data. Advanced statistical analyses from the
% web-browser or any other platform. 
% 2:  Analysis pipelines for large genomic datasets. Provenance of data. 
% 
% Common: 
% - Containers
% - Reproducibility
%     - 1: An application is an R package with the analyses. Do not need to
%     pre-compute results, can call functions etc. directly from the app. Build an
%     app as containers that can be shared. 
%     - 2: An analysis is a list of tools with 
%     input/output data. We package each tool in a container (snapshot-ish) 

\emph{Observation}:
Collecting large biological datasets have never been simpler or cheaper. Data
generation is growing at an unprecedented rate. There are a wealth of software
packages and systems to analyze and explore these datasets, but they often
target only a small portion of the full analysis pipeline from raw data to
interpretable results.  

\emph{Challenges}:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Providing an overview of the full data transformations from raw data
        to interpretable results; 
    \item Sharing analysis pipelines and exploration tools across software
        platforms and research groups; 
    \item Providing full provenance of data, tools, and tool parameters; 
    \item Develop end-user applications that interface with advanced
        statistical analyses required to explore biological datasets.  
\end{enumerate*} 

\emph{Related work}:
There are a wealth of related work and systems. To build analysis pipelines we
have systems such as
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item CWL and its implementations: cwl\_runner, Arvados, Rabix, Toil, Galaxy,
        AWE; and 
    \item Pahchyderm. 
\end{enumerate*}
When the data is analyzed and ready for further exploration, we have systems
such as
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item OpenCPU;
    \item RStudio and Shiny; 
    \item Renjin an R interpreter built on top of the JVM. 
\end{enumerate*}
 

\emph{Our solution}: 
To provide an overview of the statistical analyses from raw data to
interpretable results we propose our tool \emph{walrus}. It lets users create
and run analysis pipelines in bioinformatics to e.g. analyze high-throughput
sequencing datasets. In addition, it tracks full provenance of the input,
intermediate, and output data, as well as tool parameters. With \emph{walrus} we
have successfully built analysis pipelines to detect somatic mutations in breast
cancer patients. 

To develop applications that interface with the underlying statistical analyses
we have built \emph{Kvik}. Kvik allows applications written in any modern
programming language to interface with the wealth of bioinformatics packages in
the R programming language, as well as information available through online
databases. We have used Kvik to develop the MIxT system for exploring and
comparing transcriptional profiles from blood and tumor samples in breast cancer
patients. 

\emph{Advantages of our solution}:
Our analysis solution has the benefit that it integrates with modern version
control systems to provide provenance information on datasets. It also runs on a
wide range of software platforms and is targeted to the compute infrastructure
found in hospital environment. 

Our solution to build data explorations provides the benefit of developers being
able to develop applications in any programming language. It also facilitates
the reuse and interface with the wealth of statistical packages directly from a
user-interface rather than analysis scripts.

\emph{Long term contributions}:
Discuss why our approach works out nicely? Benefit for future use? Clinical
apps?
