% observation
There is a rapid growth in the number of available biological datasets due to
the decreaseing cost of data collection.  This brings opportunities to gain
novel insights to the underlying biological mechanisms in the development and
progression of diseases such as cancer.  The wide range of different biological
datasets has led to the development of a wealth of software packages and systems
to explore and analyze these datasets.  However, these tools typically target
only small portions of the deep analysis pipeline required to transform the raw
data into interpretable results. While the tools are used to provide novel
insights in diseases, there is little emphasis on reporting and sharing
information about tool versions, input parameters, and other information that
can help others use the same methods on their own datasets. This leads to
unneccesary difficilties to reuse known methods, and difficulties in reproducing
analyses, which leads to unrealized potential for scientific insights and
commercial use in the available datasets. 

% challenge
There are several challenges at hand for researchers to analyze and explore
biological datasets. The first is the time and knowledge to find and set up the
necessary tools to start analyzing a modern biological dataset. The second is
ensuring the correct input parameters, tool versions, database versions, and
dataset versions when analyzing and reporting analysis results. The final
challenge is the need for flexible and highly configurable analysis tools to
support the large variation in study design and datatypes. These challenges are
common for large datasets such as high-throughput sequencing data that require
long-running, deep analysis pipelines, as well as smaller datasets, such as
microarray data, that require complex, but short-running analysis pipelines. 

As a result, there are a wealth of approaches and systems to enable analysis of
the complex biological data. To develop analysis pipelines, Galaxy\cite{galaxy}
has for a long time provided a simple interface to set up and execute analysis
pipelines for genomic datasets. However, the Galaxy system is less effective for
explorative and flexible analyses.\cite{spjuth2015experiences}
Pachyderm\cite{pachyderm} is a system for developing more flexible analyses that
support comparison of pipeline runs from different workflow configurations and
datasets. However it has yet to see wide-spread adpotion in Bioinformatics.
New initiatives such as the \gls{cwl} provide users a standardized way of
describing an analysis pipeline and has multiple implementations such as
the reference implementation
cwl\_runner,\footnote{\url{github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool}}
Arvados,\cite{arvados} Rabix,\cite{rabix} Toil,\cite{toil} Galaxy,\cite{galaxy}
and AWE.\cite{awe} While these systems provide system for batch-processing of
large datasets, systems such as Shiny and OpenCPU provide interactive
interfaces to the R programming language and the many packages for biological
data processing in Bioconductor. 
With new analysis systems and frameworks continuing to be implemented every
year, it seems that enabling reproducible analyses of high-throughput datasets
is still an area that require thorough consideration and developer effort.

Our analysis solution has the benefit that it integrates with modern version
control systems to provide provenance information on datasets. It also runs on a
wide range of software platforms and is targeted to the compute infrastructure
found in hospital environment. 

Our solution to build data explorations provides the benefit of developers being
able to develop applications in any programming language. It also facilitates
the reuse and interface with the wealth of statistical packages directly from a
user-interface rather than analysis scripts. 

The resulting approach as several key advantages over current systems:

\section{Use of the CDAM} 

To provide an overview of the statistical analyses from raw data to
interpretable results we propose our tool \emph{walrus}. It lets users create
and run analysis pipelines in bioinformatics to e.g. analyze high-throughput
sequencing datasets. In addition, it tracks full provenance of the input,
intermediate, and output data, as well as tool parameters. With \emph{walrus} we
have successfully built analysis pipelines to detect somatic mutations in breast
cancer patients. 

To develop applications that interface with the underlying statistical analyses
we have built \emph{Kvik}. Kvik allows applications written in any modern
programming language to interface with the wealth of bioinformatics packages in
the R programming language, as well as information available through online
databases. We have used Kvik to develop the MIxT system for exploring and
comparing transcriptional profiles from blood and tumor samples in breast cancer
patients.
